I find it fascinating that you can get a text file, roughly 25meg big that contains what is essentially a diff against a common shared genetic code, it's certainly millions of years of progress, but yet can be transferred to your computer in a matter of seconds. Maybe at some point in the future bad things could happen because of this. But it's worth it for this one simple line.

Inside is a text version of my DNA. Fields are TAB-separated. Each line corresponds to a single SNP. For each SNP, we provide its identifier (an rsid or an internal id), its location on the reference human genome, and the genotype call oriented with respect to the plus strand on the human reference sequence.

It is built using reference human assembly [build 36](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/mapview/map_search.cgi?taxid=9606&build=36).
